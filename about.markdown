I am a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow based at the University of Surrey and specialising in nuclear physics. I received my PhD from the University of York in 2014 before taking up positions at TRIUMF (Vancouver, Canada) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (California) before moving to Surrey in 2020.

A list of my publications in peer-reviewed journals can be found [here](/research/publications).
