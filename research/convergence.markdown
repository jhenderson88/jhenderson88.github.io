## How much data do we need to know the shape of a nucleus?

All atomic nuclei tend to exhibit some kind of quadrupole deformation, typically observed in the form of fluctuations about the nuclear surface (vibrations) and/or rotations of a deformed object about one of its axes. We can try to determine how deformed a nucleus is by examining a number of properties and comparing it to models. 

Alternatively, we can use properties of electromagnetism[^1] to try to access this deformation directly, without needing to compare to models. To do this experimentally we need, in principle, a near infinite amount of nuclear data - a major problem. In practice, however, certain nuclear data is likely to contribute most strongly. 

Using a nuclear model[^2] and steadily increasing the amount of data used, we can attempt to work out how much data we need to be confident of a nucleus's shape. The animation below shows the shape evolving as more states are included in the calculation, as well as how the parameters converge towards an answer.
